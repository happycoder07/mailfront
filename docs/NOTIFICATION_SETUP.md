# Email Notification Setup

This document explains how to set up and use email notifications for new pending emails in the Mail Manager application.

## Overview

The email notification system automatically checks for new emails in pending state and notifies users through:

- In-app toast notifications
- Browser system notifications
- Optional notification sounds

## Features

### Notification Types

1. **Toast Notifications**: In-app notifications that appear in the top-right corner
2. **Browser Notifications**: System-level notifications that appear even when the app is minimized
3. **Sound Notifications**: Audio alerts when new emails arrive (optional)

### Configuration Options

- **Enable/Disable**: Turn notifications on or off completely
- **Check Interval**: How often to check for new emails (10s, 30s, 1min, 5min)
- **Notification Types**: Choose which types of notifications to receive
- **Sound**: Enable/disable audio notifications

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Access Notification Settings

1. Navigate to `/settings` in the application
2. Find the "Email Notifications" section
3. Configure your preferences

### 2. Browser Notification Permission

1. Enable "Browser Notifications" in settings
2. Click "Request Permission" when prompted
3. Allow notifications in your browser's permission dialog

### 3. Optional: Add Notification Sound

To enable sound notifications:

1. Add an MP3 file named `notification-sound.mp3` to the `public/` directory
2. The file should be a short, pleasant notification sound (1-3 seconds)
3. Enable "Notification Sound" in settings

### 4. Configure Check Interval

Choose how often the system should check for new emails:

- **Every 10 seconds**: Most responsive, higher server load
- **Every 30 seconds**: Good balance (recommended)
- **Every minute**: Lower server load
- **Every 5 minutes**: Minimal server load

## How It Works

### Email Detection

- The system polls the email API every configured interval
- Only emails with "PENDING" status are monitored
- New emails are detected by comparing with previous check results

### Notification Triggers

Notifications are shown when:

- A new email arrives in pending state
- The user has permission to view emails
- Notifications are enabled in settings

### Notification Content

Each notification includes:

- Email sender address
- Email subject
- Timestamp of when the email was received
- Click action to view the email

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Working

1. Check that you have permission to view emails
2. Verify notifications are enabled in settings
3. Ensure browser notifications are allowed
4. Check browser console for any errors

### Browser Notifications Blocked

1. Click the lock/info icon in your browser's address bar
2. Find "Notifications" in the site settings
3. Change from "Block" to "Allow"
4. Refresh the page

### Sound Not Working

1. Ensure the notification sound file exists in `public/notification-sound.mp3`
2. Check that your browser allows autoplay
3. Verify your system volume is not muted

### High Server Load

If you notice high server load:

1. Increase the check interval to a higher value
2. Consider disabling notifications during peak hours
3. Monitor the application's performance metrics

## Security Considerations

- Notifications only work for users with email viewing permissions
- Browser notifications require explicit user consent
- All notification data is stored locally in the browser
- No notification data is sent to external services

## API Endpoints Used

The notification system uses these API endpoints:

- `GET /mail?status=PENDING&pageSize=50` - Fetch pending emails
- All requests include CSRF tokens for security

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support for all features
- **Firefox**: Full support for all features
- **Safari**: Full support for all features
- **Mobile browsers**: Limited support for browser notifications

## Performance Impact

- **Low impact**: 30-second intervals with minimal data transfer
- **Memory usage**: ~1MB for notification state storage
- **CPU usage**: Negligible polling overhead
- **Network usage**: ~2KB per check request
